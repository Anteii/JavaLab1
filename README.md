# First practical work for Java course.
### Data Domain
I choose library domain simple yet interesting (at least i thought so).

### Database
In this work I use free remote hosting ElephantSQL (Azure Postrgre instance)

### Description
The main goal of this work is to get used with Java EE stack and expirience all this pain by yourself.
There're 3 entity. Access to them is managed with DAO classes.
There're also several servletes that processed different relations. 
Data update on front is done via fetch, so no .jsp.
JDBC Connection Pool and JDBC Resources were configured in glassfish admin panel with respect to free hosting limitations.
